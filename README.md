# EncryptID

EncryptID is a decentralized digital identity and verification system built on blockchain technology. It provides secure and transparent identity verification using decentralized systems and AI integration.

## Features

- **Decentralized Identity Management:** Store and manage identities on a blockchain (Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric).
- **Credential Verification:** Issue, verify, and revoke credentials securely.
- **Integration with AI:** Use AI models like Facial Recognition or Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for enhanced identity verification.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Built using Go and Rust for high performance and scalability.
- **Event-Driven Processing:** Utilizes Kafka or RabbitMQ for event processing and data synchronization.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Docker and Kubernetes (K8s) for containerization and orchestration.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki for monitoring and logging.

## Smart Contracts

- **Identity.sol:** Manages user identities and associated attributes.
- **Credential.sol:** Handles issuance, verification, and revocation of credentials.
- **AccessControl.sol (Optional):** Manages access control for sensitive operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (for npm packages).
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (for containerized deployment).
- Install [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (for microservices development).
- Set up a blockchain platform (Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric) and IPFS for decentralized storage.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/EncryptID.git
   cd EncryptID
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Install Go dependencies
   go mod download
   
   # Install Rust dependencies (if any)
   # rustup install <version>
   ```

3. **Deploy Smart Contracts:**
   - Deploy Identity.sol and Credential.sol on your chosen blockchain platform.

4. **Configure and Run:**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables and configuration files
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configurations

   # Build and run microservices
   go build -o encryptid-service cmd/main.go
   ./encryptid-service

   # Start Docker containers for Kafka or RabbitMQ, IPFS, and other services
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Access EncryptID:**
   - Access the EncryptID web interface or CLI tool for identity verification and credential management.
