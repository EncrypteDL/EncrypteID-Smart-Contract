# EncrypteID Smart Contract

EncrypteID is a decentralized platform for digital identity and credential verification using blockchain technology. This repository contains the smart contracts written in Solidity, along with Python and Go code for interacting with the contracts and supporting infrastructure.


## Dependencies

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity**: Used for writing smart contracts.
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: Standard libraries for secure smart contract development.
- **Truffle**: Development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain emulator for testing.

### Python
- **Web3.py**: Python library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain.
- **dotenv**: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for creating APIs.

### Go
- **Go-Ethereum (geth)**: Ethereum client implementation in Go.
- **Gorilla/Mux**: HTTP router and URL matcher for building Go web servers.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EncrypteDL/EncrypteID-Smart-Contract.git
   cd EncrypteID-Smart-Contract
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   **For Smart Contracts:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g truffle
   npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```

   **For Python:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **For Go:**
   ```bash
   go get github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
   go get github.com/gorilla/mux
   ```

3. **Compile and Deploy Contracts**
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   truffle migrate --network <network_name>
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your environment variables:

   ```
   WEB3_PROVIDER=<Your Ethereum Provider URL>
   PRIVATE_KEY=<Your Private Key>
   ```

5. **Run Python Scripts**

   You can run Python scripts to interact with the smart contracts:
   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```

## Example Output

After successfully deploying the contracts and running the Python script to interact with them, you might see output similar to the following:

```plaintext
Connecting to the Ethereum network...
Account: 0xYourAccountAddress
Balance: 5.0 ETH

Fetching available elections...
Election: Presidential Election 2024
Candidates:
1. Candidate Name A - Votes: 1200
2. Candidate Name B - Votes: 950
3. Candidate Name C - Votes: 870

Creating a new election...
Transaction successful! Election 'New Election' created with end time: 1625164800

Running for office...
Transaction successful! You are now a candidate in the 'New Election'.
```
